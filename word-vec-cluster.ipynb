    "# Using Pre-Trained Word Vectors for Clustering Text Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice for clustering word documents involves using Tfidf vectorization along with KMeans. This of course is simple and powerful - but essentially has the limits of known bag of words - which in case of sparsity of ground truth can have poor results. Now with pre-trained word vectors, once can theoretically overcome the some of this limitations as rather than clustering on ground truth embodied in just the training set, one can gain the power of a much larger word space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example provides an implementation where one can choose to cluster through Tfidf vectorization - or use pre-trained word vectors. One can see that by using pre-trained word vectors, \"Orange is hip\" is correctly clustered with the other similar color based sentences, while \"Cooking is my hobby\" is positioned closer to the food sentences!\n"
